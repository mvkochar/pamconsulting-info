                                    Answer: While a residency card can be obtained within two months through the fast-track process, 
                                    a permanent resident of Cyprus can apply for Cyprus Citizenship after completing 5 years (1825 days) 
                                    of legal stay in Cyprus, according to the naturalization scheme based on years of residence (M127). 
                                    Once acquired, permanent residency in Cyprus is valid for life.
