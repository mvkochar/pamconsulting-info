                                A minimum of around 4 million tourists choose Cyprus as their holiday destination per year.
                                This makes the island one of the most popular destinations in the world. In fact, many people
                                who experience life in Cyprus tend to return either for another holiday or decide to move permanently.
                                As a business entrepreneur looking to relocate, the most essential point to carefully consider is
                                the new location of your business activities. This is why apart from the outstanding business advantages
                                of Cyprus, you can also find the ideal location for you and your employees to work and live.

                                The decision to relocate your business comes with the need to discover a location with a strong and promising
                                economic future for your business. Cyprus has established its resilient economic reputation with one
                                of the fastest growth rates in the EU. This is achieved by focusing on the diversification of services
                                and business opportunities found on the island. Some of the most dominant services include communications,
                                real estate, and financial industries. The government’s efforts to support businesses has proved fundamental
                                in the growth of the economy.

                                Since the 1st of January 2022, the Government of Cyprus has launched a new action plan to attract

                                This creates unlimited possibilities when it comes to growing your business in Cyprus.
